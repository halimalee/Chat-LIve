     <p>
        Chat LIve Kenya was founded in January 2020 with the aim
        to link you to the pool of counselors we have in Kenya.Taking care of your mental health is underestimated
        but the reality is that to be a progressive and productive to yourself and to everyone else around us.Messaging 
        with your therapist is only between Ksh.100 and Ksh.500 per hour,
        no matter how much you talk with no hidden charges. <br>
        We would all frown less, fight less, and avoid reaching melt downs and breakdowns.       
        Kenya has had a high rising cases of suicide and
        unnecessary gender based violence. Statistics places Kenya as 6th country
        with the highest number of depression cases.<br>
